# World_Weather_Analysis

The challenge was revised on Sunday 2/23/20.  The travel itinerary was changed to a round-trip drive along the east coast of Australia, starting in Batemans Bay in the south, moving north through several cities to Mackay, then returning to Batemans Bay (initially it had just been one-way from Batemans Bay to Mackay).  The 3 image files requested were also updated and placed in the main repository rather than a subfolder.

Per the challenge instructions:

1.  My code for parts 1, 2, and 3 of the challenge.
    1. Weather_Database.ipynb.
    2. Vacation_Search.ipynb (revised 2/23/20).
    3. Vacation_Itinerary.ipynb (revised 2/23/20).
    
2.  The "data" folder contains the following CSV files.
    1. WeatherPy_challenge.csv
    2. WeatherPy_vacation.csv
    **another copy of these 2 files are in the main folder.
